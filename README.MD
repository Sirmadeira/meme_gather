# Meme Gatherer and Ranker

## Overview
This project collects meme data, processes images through an OCR pipeline, and extracts textual information embedded in memes.

The primary goal is educational: to learn how to design and operate continuous data-extraction processes that rely on undocumented or semi-hidden APIs, run autonomously, and are containerized for deployment.

The system runs inside a Docker container deployed on a Raspberry Pi, operating locally in a way similar to an AWS Lambda job triggered on a schedule.

In addition to data extraction, this project was built to practice Python engineering best practices, including structured logging, error handling, documentation, and maintainable pipeline design.
