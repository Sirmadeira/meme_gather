#  Meme gatherer and ranker

## Overview
A project of mine that collects meme data passes it through an OCR model and extract all precious text information from it.
Made solely for learning how to build extraction processes related to hidden apis, that run continously, in docker environments. 
In this case I deployed the container in my raspberry and run it locally similar to a lambda job in AWS.
I also made it to learn pythonic good practices such as logging, documentation.
You can lear more about if by just opening the exploration notebook.
